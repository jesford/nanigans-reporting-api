# NanStats

Welcome to NanStats; a Python wrapper around the Nanigans Reporting API 2.0. 

## Acknowledgements

The model and structures are largely based on the work from [TwitterAds](https://github.com/essence-tech/twitter-ads-api), which I found to be a very nice interpretation of objects found in the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library.
